A special value of matrices and Matrix Algebra is that they nable to express many operations arising in mathematics, statistics and many other fields in a clear concise manner. Matrices also enhance the understanding of which apsects generalize to higher dimensions.


###Matrices and Transformations

####$R \to R$ 

$$y=ax$$

A single number $\underline{a}$ represents linear transformation.

####$R^2 \to R$ 

$$y=a_1x_1+a_2x_2$$

Vector $\mathbf{A}=(a_1, a_2)$ represents linear transformation.

####$R^2 \to R^2$ 


$$\begin{cases} y_1 = a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2\\ y_2 = a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 \end{cases}$$

Matrix  $\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ represents linear transformation.

1. What matrix corresponds to a linear mapping?

2. What matrix corresponds to a linear maping $R^{10} \to R^{20}?$
\end{tcolorbox}

Thus, for linear mappings:

- $R \to R$  | given by numbers

- $R^{n} \to R^{m}$  | given by matrices


So, we can write compactly

 \begin{equation}\label{eqn:matrix}\underline{y}=A\underline{x}\end{equation}
 
 where
 
 $$\underline{y}=\binom{y_1}{y_2},  A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix} , \underline{x}=\binom{x_1}{x_2}$$


Note that equation \eqref{eqn:matrix} looks similar to the linear equation in the case of $R \to R$

In general, for transformation $R^{n} \to R^{m}$, a matrix  $$\begin{pmatrix}A\end{pmatrix}_{m*n}$$ reprezents a linear transformation. 

Viewing matrices as linear transformations can help understand, seemingly strange definition of a product of matrices as well as:

- Addition of matrices

- Multiplication by a scalar

- Inverse
