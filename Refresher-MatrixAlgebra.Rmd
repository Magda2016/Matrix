A special value of matrices and Matrix Algebra is that they nable to express many operations arising in mathematics, statistics and many other fields in a clear concise manner. Matrices also enhance the understanding of which apsects generalize to higher dimensions.


###Matrices and Transformations

####$R \to R$ 

$$y=ax$$

A single number $\underline{a}$ represents linear transformation.

####$R^2 \to R$ 

$$y=a_1x_1+a_2x_2$$

Vector $\mathbf{A}=(a_1, a_2)$ represents linear transformation.

####$R^2 \to R^2$ 


$$\begin{cases} y_1 = a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2\\ y_2 = a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 \end{cases}$$

Matrix  $\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ represents linear transformation.

$\bullet$ Q: What Matrix corresponds to a linear mapping

####$R^{10} \to R^{20}$ ?             

$\bullet$ Thus, for linear mappings:


####$R \to R$  | given by numbers

####$R^{n} \to R^{m}$  | given by matrices


$\bullet$ So, we can write compactly

($\star$)  $\underline{y}$=A$\underline{x}$ ; $\underline{y}$=$\binom{y_1}{y_2}$,  A = $\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ , $\underline{x}$=$\binom{x_1}{x_2}$


Note that ($\star$) looks similar to the linear equation in the case of $R \to R$



$\bullet$ In general, $R^{n} \to R^{m}$  a matrix  $\begin{pmatrix} A_{mxn}\end{pmatrix}$  - reprezents linear transformation.


$\bullet$ Viewing matrices as linear transformations can help understand, e.g., seemingly strange definition of a product of matrices as well as:
