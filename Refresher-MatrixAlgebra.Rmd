A special value of matrices and Matrix Algebra is that they nable to express many operations arising in mathematics, statistics and many other fields in a clear concise manner. Matrices also enhance the understanding of which apsects generalize to higher dimensions.


###Matrices and Transformations

####$R \to R$ 

$$y=ax$$

A single number $a$ represents linear transformation.

####$R^2 \to R$ 

$$y=a_1x_1+a_2x_2$$

Vector $\mathbf{A}=(a_1, a_2)$ represents linear transformation.

####$R^2 \to R^2$
